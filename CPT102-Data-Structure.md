# CPT102-Data Structure



## Lecture 1

### Data structure

A data structure is a systematic way of organizing a collection of data for efficient access.

Each of them requires some specific algorithms to be operated (insertion, deletion, retrieval, etc.).

#### Why learning

>  Aren’t primitive types, like boolean, integers and strings, and simple arrays enough?

Data structure in this lesson is built from primitive types, for describing the complex solutions abstractly.



#### Data structure covers

- General issues in data structure design;
- One dimensional and multi dimensional arrays;
- Linked lists, doubly linked lists and operations on these data structures;
- Stacks and operations on stacks;
- Queues and operations on queues;
- Maps and operations on maps;
- Trees & Graphs.



#### What will we focus on the data structures...?

- properties
- organization
- operations



#### What will we learn?

- Array
- Lists
- Stacks
- Queues(not learnt)(队列)
- Maps
- Trees
- Graphs







### Algorithm

#### Why study algorithms?

- The diffrent need of achieving the goal(coverage, speed, etc.)
- Optimization(in exec. time or )



Dijkstra's algorithm (SSSP- single source shortest path) can compute the shortest path efficiently.(graph)

(MST) minimum spanning tree 





- Algorithms **will terminate** but programs may not.

#### Our focus on algorithms

- Algorithms that create , access , manipulate 







#### Where are we going?

- Using the Java Collection Library
- Designing and Creating new Collection classes
- How to add, remove, search, sort, etc. efficiently
  - Fundamental algo



#### Q&A

- Why algorithm must terminate
  - s
- Why precise
- why  are written in a sequence
  - l
- Write down an algorithm to start up IE on a computer
  - Input: a windows computer with IE which is shut down
  - Output: 



### Software Quality

Evaluated from:

- Correctness
- Efficiency



### Abstraction

We talk this either as a process or as an entity.

#### Abstraction as a process

Extracting essential details of a (group) of item(s).



#### Abstraction as a entity

a {model, view, representation} for an actual item which can extract essential details from it.



#### Kinds of abstractions

- **data abstraction** - identify which details of how data is stored and can be manipulated are important and which are not
- **procedural abstraction** - identify which details of how a task is accomplished are important and which are not



#### What should we find in abstractions

- Commonality
- Outside view of the viewed.









#### Huffman Codes

can find amount sorting of the data in huffman codes (?

The problem is the codebook can be easily reverse enginneered.
